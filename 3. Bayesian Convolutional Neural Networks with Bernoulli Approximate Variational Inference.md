# Introduction

- **Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** are popular deep learning tool for image processing.
- CNNs require huge amounts of data for regularisation and quickly over-fit on small data.
- In contrast **Bayesian neural networks (NNs)** are robust to over-fitting, offer uncertainty estimates, and can easily learn from small datasets.
- Because of the vast number of parameters and extremely large models commonly used in practical applications.
- However, modelling a distribution over the kernels (also known as filters) of a CNN has never been attempted successfully before.
